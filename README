This program helps determine which working group drafts reference
particular technologies.  For example, the RADEXT working group can
use it to determine which *other* working group documents reference
RADIUS.  Those documents can then be reviewed by the RADEXT working
group.

It does this by:

* grabbing a copy of the "internet-drafts" directory from ftp.rfc-editor.org

* scanning the list of working group drafts

* for each WG draft, scanning it to find the list of normative
  references

* for each interesting RFC, print out which drafts reference those
  RFCS.


USAGE
-----

The script needs a local copy of all of the internet drafts.  This is
retrieved by running this command:

	$ make sync

It uses 'rsync' to grab the drafts.  It may take 5-10 minutes,
depending on your system and network connection.  The sync should be
done once a day AT MOST.  Ideally, once a week.  Doing it more often
will overload the IETF rsync server.

The main program is ietf-tech-report :

	$ ./ietf-tech-report radius

This prints a list of internet-drafts which reference the "radius"
technology.


TECHNOLOGIES
------------

Instead of requiring you to remember lists of RFCs and working groups,
this program uses a simple "technology" concept.  he technologies are
defined in the file "tech.txt".  This file should be edited to add
whatever data you need about a particular "technology".  Lists of
RFCs, working groups, etc.

The format is pretty simple:

	NAME -WG -WG #### #### ####

  NAME = name of the technology.  e.g. radius
  -WG  = which working groups to avoid.  e.g. -radext -dime
  #### = RFC number.  e.g. 2865 2866 2867

This configuration allows you to just use NAME for a technology,
rather than giving a list of RFCs.  The ability to exclude working
groups comes because we presume that the WG is already aware of its
own documents.  The purpose of this tool is to find documents in
*other* working groups which use a technology.  They might not be
aware of best practices, and you might not be aware of what they're
doing.


DETAILED USAGE
--------------

The help text is as follows:

	$ ./ietf-tech-report  -h
	ietf-tech-report [-h] [-i] [-n] [-r LIST] [-W EXCLUDE]
	   -h         print this message
	   -i         include informative references, too
	   -k         keyword(s) to look for
	   -n         include normatice references (default)
	   -r LIST    comma-separated list of key RFCs
	   -W EXCLUDE comma-separated list of working groups to exclude
	
	              See the file 'tech.txt' for more configuration

The '-r' and '-W' options take a comma-separated list of words.
e.g. '-r 2865,2866,2867', or '-W radext,dime'.

	$ ./ietf-tech-report -r 2865 -W radext,dime

This prints out a list of drafts (and status) which reference RFC
2865.  The "radext" and "dime" working group douments are excluded
from the list.

	$ /ietf-tech-report -r 2865,2866,2867,2868,2869,3162,3575,3579,3580,4675,5080,5090,5176,6158 -W radext,dime

This prints out a larger list of drafts which reference any of the
above RFCs.

It is usually simpler to just use "./ietf-tech-report radius".

It is also possible to generate a report by searching for a keyword.
Only one keyword can be specified.  e.g. -k "performance metric".
Searches are case insensitive.


SENDING EMAIL
-------------

The Makefile can be edited to send a weekly summary to a working group
mailing list.  To enable this, edit the Makefile, and set the
following variables:

	TECH = radius

The technology to search for.

	FROM = user@example.com

The user to send mail "from".

	TO = wg@ietf.org

The name of the working group mailing list.  The "FROM" user must be
subscribed to the list.

Then:

	$ make mail.txt

To make a message suitable for sending to a working group mailing
list.  The header is in the file "top.txt".

Finally send the mail:

	$ make send


CRON
----

I suggest sending email once a week, via a cron job:

	22 1 * * 0 /usr/bin/make -s -C /path/to/directory sync send

Be warned that the "sync" portion might take 5-10 minutes.  You may
want to run the "sync" first, and then 15 minutes later, run the
"send" portion.
