This program helps determine which working group drafts reference
particular technologies.  For example, the RADEXT working group can
use it to determine which *other* working group documents reference
RADIUS.  Those documents can then be reviewed by the RADEXT working
group.

It does this by:

* grabbing a copy of the "internet-drafts" directory from ftp.rfc-editor.org

* scanning the list of working group drafts

* for each WG draft, scanning it to find the list of normative
  references

* for each interesting RFC, print out which drafts reference those
  RFCS.


USAGE

	$ make sync

This uses 'rsync' to grab the set of drafts.  This may take 5-10
minutes, depending on your system and network connection.  We
recommend this be done once a day AT MOST.  Ideally, once a week.

The main program is ietf-tech-report :

	$ ./ietf-tech-report -r radius

This prints a list of internet-drafts which reference the "radius"
technology.


TECHNOLOGIES

The technologies are defined in the file "tech.txt".  This file should
be edited to add whatever technology you need.

The format is pretty simple:

	NAME -WG -WG ### ### ###

  NAME = name of the technology.  e.g. radius
  -WF  = which working groups to avoid.  e.g. -radext -dime
  #### = RFC number.  e.g. 2865 2866 2867


DETAILED USAGE

The program takes two command-line options, -r and -W.  Each is a
comma-delimited list of words.  e.g. -r 2865,2866,2867.  -W
radext,dime.

	$ ./ietf-tech-report -r 2865 -W radext,dime

This prints out a list of drafts (and status) which reference RFC
2865.  The "radext" and "dime" working groups are exluded from the
list.

	$ /ietf-tech-report -r 2865,2866,2867,2868,2869,3162,3575,3579,3580,4675,5080,5090,5176,6158 -W radext,dime

This prints out a more comprehensive list of drafts which reference
any of the above RFCs.

It is probably simpler to just use "-r radius".


SENDING EMAIL

It is useful to send a weekly summary to a working group mailing list.
To enable this, edit the Makefile, and set the following variables:

	TECH = radius

The technology to search for.

	FROM = user@example.com

The user to send mail "from".

	TO = wg@ietf.org

The name of the working group mailing list.  The "FROM" user must be
subscribed to the list.

Then:

	$ make mail.txt

To make a message suitable for sending to a working group mailing
list.  The header is in the file "top.txt".

Finally send the mail:

	$ make send


CRON

I suggest sending email once a week, via a cron job:

	22 1 * * 0 /usr/bin/make -s -C /path/to/directory sync send

Be warned that the "sync" portion might take 5-10 minutes.  You may
want to wrap the cron job with a shell script.
